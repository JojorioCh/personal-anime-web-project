           <h2>Welcome to my Page!!!</h2>
           <p>Although I can't guarantee all anime are amazing, there are definitely shows that would appeal to anyone. So, whether you want to have a good laugh, cry, be gripped by suspense, or just let your watch mindlessly absurd storylines, I have shared links below each genre that I focussed on as well as links on the navbar that can take you to My Anime List, What I have watched(TBC (¬_¬")), crunchyroll and Gigguk, an OG Anime youtuber. 
           <br>
           <br>
           have fun!!

        <h1>Kinds of Anime</h1>
        <h3>Shounen</h3>
        <div class="imgph"></div>
        <p><b>the primary target audience alternately defined as 9 to 18 years old and as 12 to 18 years old males.</p>
        <p>Shounen is probably the most recognized Anime category, Thanks to the popularization of Dragonball Z, One of the most recognized Anime by many. Other big names in this genre of Anime include One piece (one of the longest running series with over 1000+ episodes), Naruto, My Hero Academia</p>
        <p>Click <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen" target="_blank">here</a> to go to My Anime List for other Shounen which may be worth watching </b></p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        
        <h3>Shoujo</h3>
        <div class="imgph2"></div>
        <p><b>Although not my favourite...</p>
        <p>Shoujo anime do have interesting and gripping stories. A lot of Hard Hitting Romances plot lines, but also some with action that can be comparable to Shounen, Shoujo is targeted towards a more female audience</p>
        <p>With this being my least knowlegeable genre, click<a href="https://myanimelist.net/featured/1567/Top_15_Best_Shoujo_Anime_of_All_Time" target="_blank"> here</a> to head to My Anime List for a top 15 Shoujo List that may give you some ideas where to start.</b></p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        
        <h3>Seinen</h3>
        <div class="imgph3"></div>
        <p><b>For the more mature (❤´艸｀❤)</p>
        <p>Seinen anime have some surreal stories and honestly it is one of my favourite genres. You can find psychological dramas, comedies, violence driven plots in this genre, told amazingly. Although not as popular as Shounen, Seinen definitely is my favourite genre.</p>
